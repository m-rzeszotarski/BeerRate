# BeerRate

This application is intended to fulfill two functions: a service for users to rate beers and an e-commerce with beers brew by myself.
I didn't want to divide this application into two, so both the beer rating part and the store part are included in one 'webpage' application.

## Packages

For this project I used few additional packages

## Beer Rating Classes

The "Beer" class is the main model in the application. Any logged-in user can create it by a form. It has author, date, beer-specific variables and a boolean "isapproved".
When user creates a new beer in database it must be approved by superuser ("isapproved" False -> True), before it will be shown in "beer_list" page.

The second class is the "Review". Each user can add it to the existing Beer in the database (it consist of an user rating and a comment). Each review is assigned to specific beer by foreign key. Review can be banned by superuser (boolean "banned" False -> True).
One user can add only one review of specific beer (it is described in the next section). 

## Beer Rating Functions

There are two important Class Based Views. reviews_avg which finds reviews for specific beer, calculates average of users rating and rounds the result up to one decimal place. The second one is reviews_counter which counts number of review for specific beer. 

For some of function based views I used decorators to restrict access: @login_required - access only for logged-in users, @user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_superuser) - access only for superuser. 
In html some sections are hidden from not logged-in users {% if user.is_authenticated %}, some sections are shown only for superuser {% if user.is_superuser %}.

From home.html useres can access Beer Ranking, superuser also can access list of beers pending for approval.
Approved Beers are displayed in Data Table in beer_list.html. It enables to search and filter beers existing in the database. More details and reviews can be displayed in beer_detail.html where users can also add their reviews.
Only one review can be added by one user fore one beer. In view beer_detail, before saving new review form, function is looking if user have already created review (by objects.filter and .count()). 
If the count is > 0 old review is deleted and only new is saved. 

## E-commerce Classes

The "MyBeer" is a class created for items present in the shop. I did not use the option to inherit them with the "Beer" model, because this class has other parameters and functions and I wanted to keep them separate.
For cart purpose, class "CartItem" was created. By ForeignKey each CartItem is assigning to specific MyBeer from shop and user. 
To make final order the Order class was created. It contains purchaser's data, products, price and status.

## E-commerce Functions

From home.html users can access the shop, superuser can also access a page which displays all created orders. 
In the shop (mybeer_list.html) logged-in users can add beers to the cart. Superuser can also add new mybeers by a form.
In the cart (cart.html) users can change quantity of chosen items or remove them. Total price is calculated by multiplying quantity of items in cart by their price. 
If user want to make an order, he is redirected to a form which he must fill with his personal data. Cart items are found by filtering by user. Price is caluleted on the same principle as in cart but also shipping charge is added. 
After order form is saved, items from cart are deleted. To manage order status few functions were created. Superuser cane use them from order_list.html page. 

## Plans for improvement

- Add possibility to fill purchaser's data in user tab - this data will be used by default in order form.
- Add multiple shipping options
- Paypal integration for payment
- Ban reviews (boolean is present but there is no function for changing it)
